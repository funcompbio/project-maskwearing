# Project mask wearing - FCB 2026

## Summary

In this project you should analyse data to attempt answering the following
question:

> Do political views influence wearing a mask in public to minimize transmission of COVID19?

## Data

You should use the following two datasets:

1. A survey conducted in 2020 in the USA by the New York Times on wearing a mask
   in public and available
   [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/mask-use). The
   dataset is in a CSV file called `mask-use-by-county.csv`.

2. Results of the 2020 USA general election presidential results by county and
   available
   [here](https://github.com/tonmcg/US_County_Level_Election_Results_08-24).
   The dataset is in a CSV file called
   `2020_US_County_Level_Presidential_Results.csv`.

## Deliverables

The GitHub repo for this project should contain, at least, the following files:

  * `index.Rmd`: R Markdown script with the R code doing the analysis of the data
    and the corresponding text explaining those analysis steps.
  * `index.html`: Resulting HTML output from processing (_knitting_) the file
    `index.Rmd`. This file (`index.html`) and other web-related files may also be
    located in a subdirectory called `docs`, when publishing it with GitHub pages,
    but this `docs` subdirectory **cannot** have `.R` or `.Rmd` files, and both
    `index.html` at the root of the repo and `index.html` in the `docs` subdirectory
    should be identical.
  * The CSV files employed during the analysis.
  * This `README.md` file.

Object names in the R code in `.Rmd` and `.R` files **should not** contain
non-english characters such as `ç` or `ñ` or accents such as `à`, `é`, etc.
The analysis of the data described in the HTML file should contain the following
sections:

  * **Front matter:** This is the basic information of the project that should
    appear at the beginning and should consist of the following items: title of
    the project including at the end or as subtitle "FCB 2026", names of the
    authors and date. Here the words _Front Matter_ **should not** be included
    as section name.
  * **Abstract:** Summary of the question and the findings (max. 200 words).
  * **Introduction:** Description of the question and the data employed to
    answer it. Description of any steps taken, if any, previous to this R
    Markdown document, to prepare the data that is being analyzed.
  * **Results:** R code interspersed with text, describing the analysis steps
    and the display items with the results, which should consist, **at least**,
    of one table and one plot.
  * **Conclusions:** summary of the findings, limitations of the study, ways in
    which this type of study could be improved in the future.
  * **AI assistance:** description of any use of AI tools to help with the
    analysis, including the specific prompts used, the output obtained from
    those prompts, and if you directly accepted the output or you had to
    modify it, and why. If you have not used any AI tool, you should explicitly
    state that in this section.
  * **References:** bibliographic references.

## Methodology

The analysis of the data should be carried out at least using R, but you can
also use shell or Python scripts to transform or prepare the data for the
analysis with R. If those prior steps using shell or Python scripts are
included, they should be described in the introduction section of the R
Markdown document and, ideally, made readily reproducible using a
[Makefile](https://funcompbio.github.io/lecture10).

## AI assistance

You may use AI tools, preferably AI pair programming tools such as GitHub
Copilot, to help you with the analysis. If you do so, you should describe in
the "AI assistance" section of the resulting HTML file the specific prompts
used, the output obtained from those prompts, and if you directly accepted
that output or you had to modify it, and why. If you have not used any AI
tool, you should explicitly state that in this section.

If you use AI tools, please take into account the following principles:

* **Responsibility:** You are responsible for the content of your project,
  including content generated with the help of AI tools. If that content
  is not correct, your grade will reflect that, even if the content was
  generated by an AI tool.

* **Transparency:** You should document the use of AI tools in the
  "AI assistance" section. Failure to do so will be considered a breach of
  academic integrity and will be penalized accordingly.

* **Learning:** You should understand the content generated with the help of AI
  tools. If you use an AI tool to generate code, you should be able to explain
  how that code works and why it is correct. You should not use AI tools to
  outsource your brain and learning experience.

## Submission procedure

This assignment has to be submitted using GitHub Classroom. This
means that you should have cloned the GitHub repo of this assignment from
the organization account for FCB in the academic year 2025-26 at
[https://github.com/FCB-2026](https://github.com/FCB-2026)
using the submission link provided at the FCB Moodle site.

To complete your submission (see rubric below) one team member should fill up a
Google form provided at the FCB Moodle site before the deadline and **agree to
the following academic integrity statement**, by editing this README file and
placing the letter `X` between the squared brackets preceding the statement:

- [] The work here submitted has been entirely developed by the members of
  our team and it is the result of our own work, except where AI tools have
  been used, which is described in the "AI assistance" section of the resulting
  HTML file.

## Evaluation rubric

The rubric to evaluate this project consists of the following items:

1. Have all members of the group agreed to the academic integrity statement?
   Have all members of the group made a sizeable number of commits to the
   GitHub repo?

2. Does the GitHub repo contain at least the analysed CSV files along with the
   `index.Rmd` file and the resulting `index.html`?

3. Does the R Markdown file `index.Rmd`, and any other additional code, run the
   analysis without errors and generates the expected `index.html` file?

4. Does the analysis described in the resulting `index.html` file conform to
   the requested sectioning? Does each section contain the expected content?

5. Does the introduction explain clearly what is the question addressed, the
   data employed and the number of observations and variables involved?

6. Do the plots and tables show some meaningful summary of the data? Are axes
   in plots labeled in plain language and large enough to read? Are plots and
   tables referred to from the main text?

7. Does the R Markdown file `index.Rmd`, and any other additional R Markdown
   file, consists of R code interspersed with Markdown text? Is the code easy
   to read? Do the code instructions have a specific purpose?

8. Is the `index.html` and any other file forming the resulting website
   hosted in a private URL with GitHub Pages?

9. Does the GitHub repo include a _Makefile_ that automatizes the entire
   analysis pipeline and generation of the final report in the `index.html`
   file?

10. In case AI tools have been used, does this use conform to the principles of
    responsibility, transparency and learning described in the "AI assistance"
    section of this README file? Does the project as whole make an overall good
    impression?
